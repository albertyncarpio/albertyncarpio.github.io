With the recent finish of the 2020 American Presidential Elections, Americans still deeply express their viewpoints via social media, where Twitter is one of the main channels for them to voice out their beliefs and concerns. As a result, more and more individuals exchange ideas with one another, supporting their current point of view, whether they be supporting Trump, or Biden during the recently held elections. In order to understand what the Americans over Twitter want to say as their main sentiments, our group tapped into the field of Natural Language Processing to be able to determine specific sentiments from the Tweets and identify them based on their specific topics of interest, as well as the networks that surround these given topics. Our results show that homophily was strongly on display during the elections, particularly within politically aligned and sentimentally aligned networks.
